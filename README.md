# Human vs AI Code Lab

Projects built twice:  
**first by me, then improved by AI models.**  
This repository tracks how code evolves from human-written to AI-refactored.

---

## Purpose

- Build projects without AI assistance  
- Let different AI models enhance, refactor, or rewrite them  
- Compare logic, structure, and decision-making  
- Learn better coding approaches from both sides  
- Document each stage of evolution

---

## Structure

project-name/
- v1-human/ → Original human-written version
- v2-ai/ → AI-improved version
- v3-ai-alt/ → Optional: alternate AI version

makefile
Copy code

**Example:**

smart-form-validation/
- v1-human/
- v2-ai-gpt/
- v3-ai-claude/

## What I Compare

- Code organization  
- Efficiency and performance  
- Readability and maintainability  
- Error handling  
- Logic improvements  
- Unique patterns introduced by AI  

---

## Projects

- Smart Form Validation — in progress  
- More coming soon

---

## Evolution

This repository will expand as I build more human-first projects  
and test how different AI models improve them over time.

## Feedback

If you see a better approach — human or AI — feel free to suggest it.  
The goal is continuous improvement and learning.
